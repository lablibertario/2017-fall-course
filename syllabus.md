### COURSE LOGISTICS:
	SVA
	Sept. 7th - Dec 14th
	Thursdays 6-9:00PM

Here is the [course listing](http://dsi.sva.edu/course/metrics-and-data-visualization-i/).

### INSTRUCTOR:
	Aurelia Moser

### OFFICE HOURS: 
Fridays 5-6PM, by appointment via gcal - send to aurelia@mozillafoundation.org

### DESCRIPTION

Data visualizations increasingly shape the way we process the success of initiatives, and the expectations for activism and innovation globally. How might you evaluate the success or impact of a program? What skills should you hone to communicate your projects and progress to a new audience? How can technology hone critical thinking and problem framing for a particular area of social need and interest? 

This course will introduce web development for data visualization, including an introduction to web scripting languages, version control for collaborative coding, and the authorship of interactive visualization on/off the web.

The goal of the course is to compliment student's existing coursework and interests with some basic visualization skills, by course completion, helping them design, build, and deploy a data-driven interactive on a topic related to their work. Students will workshop an interactive of their own design throughout the course, punctuated by smaller exercises and lecture pairings on the topics of HTML5/CSS3, Javascript and contemporary development in open source and non-profit tech.

### OBJECTIVE + LEARNING OUTCOMES
Being successful in programming or social change initiatives involves producing under deadline. Funders, employers, collaborators, and patrons of your products will expect that you work efficiently. This course is modeled for your future success, and so deadlines will be applied to keep time with a professional pace. The final project for the course, and primary graded assignment, will depend on an agglutinative series of tasks designed to help you learn and think critically throughout the semester. 

#### LEARNING OUTCOMES:

1. how to assess, manipulate, and analyze  data
2. how to bulletproof your data
3. the merits of certain visualization types
4. the mechanics of collaboration and github
5. the basics of building interactive graphics: html/css/js/processing
6. the value of publishing and self-publishing 

#### GRADE CALCULATION:
Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:

* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 30% Assignments
* 20% Project Proposal
* 40% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course

TOTAL: 100%

It is understood that coding is tough and you may be new to this, you will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peer reviewers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

### MATERIALS
Coding is an art; you will have a series of art supplies for this course that will all be free unless otherwise noted, but will require some non-trivial investment on your part to set-up. I'm available to help if you need it.

#### INTRO TO INTERACTIVES
>"Numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on you to give them a clear and convincing voice." ~ S. Few

What is an interactive application, a data visualization, and what is this course about? We'll talk about instances of success and failure in apps, review some basics of this course and take care of some technical logistics related to Github, version control, and the basics of web literacy.

#### ASSIGNMENT
Find an interactive that you appreciate, prefereably (but not obligatorily) one that addresses a social issue of interest to you. Write 1-2 paragraphs about why you chose it, what it is about, how the interactive/online medium chosen was particularly conducive to the narrative (or wasn't). Finally, explain how it was built, do some research to define what programming language it was written in; what was its creation story (if you can find it)?

It could be something like an [NPR multimedia piece](http://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/publichousing/), as complex as a [ProPublica graphic](http://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/), as iconic as [Snowfall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek), as riveting as a [graphic novel](http://zombies.epicmagazine.com/story/5937), or as arty as [this exhibit of themed photos](http://www.themorningnews.org/gallery/people-of-the-sun), but the effort to understand and document it should be the same. Extra points for finding something not on the list above, or review something in the [13pt Graphics list](http://13pt.com/graphics/), a grouping assembled by the NYTimes.

Remember, you can view a template of what your assignment format here in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/auremoser/9dcfac8163e7737e7b5f). Check out the Markdown Tutorials and resources in the Practice section for tips!

#### NEW PLATFOR[U]MS: HOSTING FOR INTERACTIVES

>"Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories." ~ A. Shalloway

This week we'll here from an interactive developer working in a newsroom in NYC; Daniel Goddemeyer, starting the course with a talk. Our practice and assignment exercises will go over different approaches to similar topics in news and art, and ways that they might inspire eachother. 

![Congress](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auremoser/web-coding/master/_imgs/congress.jpg)

The Guardian, [_Are you reflected in the new Congress_](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2014/nov/06/-sp-congress-diversity-women-race-lgbt-are-you-represented).

#### [Daniel Goddemeyer](http://danielgoddemeyer.com/)

Daniel is a creative director, designer, and researcher who explores our relationships with technology through interactive experiments and product applications.

He's worked on interactive projects like:

* [_Subspotting_](http://subspotting.nyc/main/index.html)
* [_On Broadway_](http://on-broadway.nyc/)
* [_Selfie City_](http://www.selfiecity.net/)


#### READINGS
* [Today's Slides: Web Github](https://auremoser.github.io/web-github/)
* Few, S., [_Data art vs. data visualization_](http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1245).
* Koc, E., [_Interactive storytelling at the New York Times_](http://futurenytimes.org/reviews/interactive-storytelling/).
* Slobin, S., [_Examples of data journalism_](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_3.html).

#### PRACTICE
Continue to practice your fluency in Github commands with this online interactive tutorial.

* [Code School Interactive Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
* [On Demand Tutorials for Github](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/)
* [Visual Guide to Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/).

Finish the exercises on the Basics of HTML/CSS [Practice Site](http://webdive.ktam.org/web/basics).

Here are some other resources for Github learning:

* [Is it maintained](http://isitmaintained.com/) - check the github status of a repository
* [On Demand Tutorials for Github](https://github.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/)
* [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)


#### ASSIGNMENT
The following interactive projects deal with data about drones. Think about who handled it (that is, the topic) better:

* Motherboard: <http://motherboard.vice.com/read/faa-drone-fines>
* Muckrock: <https://www.muckrock.com/drone-census/>
* Pitch Interactive: <http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/>
* A Quiet Disposition: <http://aquietdisposition.com/>
* DroneHits: <http://dronehits.herokuapp.com/>

Why was the one you chose superior? How? What aspects are more or less compelling, what would you say is a better approach to communicating this material?

Consider the pieces and work shown by the guest lecturer, highlight some aspect of their work that seemed very difficult to you and find some resources online detailing how you would develop skills to support what you find difficult. Maybe they have to code, maybe they have to write tests or evaluate the user experience of their project, maybe they have to make high quality mockups in Illustrator. Pick something they describe that you don't understand and find ways to learn about it so you might be better prepared to deal with that in the workplace. Then write a paragraph about how you would develop this skill, what resource you would use.

## 9/21/17

#### MARK-UP/DOWN: SELF-PUBLISHING INTERACTIVE PROJECTS

>"I just wanted to share my view on the distinction I personally make between the two main types of visualization function: exploratory and explanatory" ~ A. Kirk

How can you use data visualization to innovate with integrity and intelligence in our contemporary world? There are many online venues and platforms for editorializing and delivering your message, which will you choose? This process might involve some code and custom building, but also concise research into your audience, and what guides viewers to a greater understanding of the topics you are treating. 

We'll talk about ways you can publish your work, and practice a few different methods of distributing narrative, we'll also feature a guest talk from Caroline Sinders.

![Ramadan Tweets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auremoser/web-coding/master/_imgs/ramadan.gif)

* Kirk, A., [_Storytelling and success stories_](http://www.visualisingdata.com/2013/04/discussion-storytelling-and-success-stories/).


#### PRACTICE
Try to setup up a bl.ocks account based on your gists (the first few assignments for this course should suffice). Bl.ocks accounts like [mine](http://bl.ocks.org/auremoser) are based on gists, so you're already on your way to having an online interactive portfolio, yay! You can see blocks in action in today's Interactive to Inspire above, which links to the [raw version of the interactive](http://bl.ocks.org/anonymous/raw/2f1e9a5a74ceeb88e977/) as well as [the code](http://bl.ocks.org/anonymous/2f1e9a5a74ceeb88e977) (if you remove the `raw` in the URL).

This syllabus is written in markdown. You can study how it's made by looking at the format and the rendered version. Click on `Open` (a blue link) in the Github view to compare, copy the raw text into [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) and view the side-by-side comparison.

Instructions for making a Block are in the first link below, and there are many links with helpful practice exercises below

* Bostock, M., [_Let's make a block_](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/)
* Learn CSS Layout, [Practice Site](http://learnlayout.com/)
* Howe, S., [Learn to Code: HTML/CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/)
* Tam, K., HTML/CSS [Practice Site](http://webdive.ktam.org/web/basics)
* [Visdown: Visualization Markdown](http://visdown.com/)


Optionally, you can also go over some of the basics of HTML/CSS and web pages with [this Khan Academy course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/hour-of-code/hour-of-html/v/making-webpages-intro), it will take an hour max.


#### ASSIGNMENT
Take a look at the following platforms for citizen journalism and community activism, consider the merits of each and choose one to profile. Explain in a paragraphs why it appeals to you, what you might use it for, and describe how you tested it to confirm. Propose another method of self-publishing, inspiring change or soliciting grassroots opinion if you find none of these satisfactory, and explain why it seems superior. You'll be self-publishing your final projects, so thinking about how people combine graphics and analysis in their own platforms or via ones hosted elsewhere is important.

* [Reportedly](https://medium.com/reportedly/welcome-to-reported-ly-3363a5fb7ea5)
* [Beautiful Rising](https://beautifulrising.org/)
* [Grasswire](https://www.grasswire.com/) + [Reference article](https://gigaom.com/2014/05/16/grasswire-founder-austen-allred-is-trying-to-build-a-wikipedia-style-platform-for-real-time-news/)
* [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/)

Use the rest of your time to work through one of the tutorials in the "practice" section above, and practice some HTML/CSS. 

**BONUS:** link to your first bl.ock (see "practice" above). Write a sentence or two about how you might incorporate blocks into a larger narrative, or an interactive piece.

## 9/28/17

#### DATA-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

##### NO CLASS TODAY (CHECK YOUR EMAIL FOR ASSIGNMENT 3 + COURSE UPDATES)

>"Narrative can on the one hand be broken down into a set of universal laws and principles that may transcend mediums. Stories have temporality in common (they deal with time) as well as causation (they deal with cause and effect of something). On the other hand there are the more media specific narrative affordances as for example in the way that film, opera, novel and data visualisation – because of their physicality and the dimensions open to them – would be able to give a different ‘staging’ of a story." ~ C. Twigg

What is data-driven development and what kind of stories can it help us convey? How does it relate to art, and why are visualizations such an important component to interactive development? This week, we'll identify some data sources to support solid narratives. 

![Guantanamo Calendar)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auremoser/web-coding/master/_imgs/history.jpg)

**Interactive to Inspire**:

#### PRACTICE
In prep for our study of maps and extra-journalism interactive platforms, evaluate the utility and validity of [Pattrn's projects](http://pattrn.co/), including [The Gaza Platform](https://gazaplatform.amnesty.org/), a partnership with Amnesty Intl. Another resource that might be helpful for unpacking visualizations is [Source](https://source.opennews.org/), a blog that dissects a lot of interactives for journalism articles, like this one on the Chicago [Police corruption investigation](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/how-we-made-homan-square-portrait/).

For coding practice, take a look at the [Completed](https://github.com/auremoser/web-html/tree/master/practice/completed) vs [Practice](https://github.com/auremoser/web-html/tree/master/practice/practice) files in this week's slides, and try to identify some differences that contribute to how different the visualizations look. Hint: look at the "stylesheets" or CSS files to see how they are different.

#### ASSIGNMENT
Do some research, find a few stories that inspire you, or [some that don't](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/gallery/2013/aug/01/16-useless-infographics?CMP=twt_gu). Think about what data they use to prove their assertions, or what datasets might help to bolster their arguments. 

Consider if you could develop a visualization to support that topic, or study it further. Consider what open data sources you could use (see those listed in the readings above); consider what closed data sources you might try to solicit (check out this [Five Minute Field Guide](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_0.html) to find data relevant to your idea).

Try to find one or two datasets that suit a narrative or argument you'd like to build. Write 1-3 paragraphs about:
 
* what datasets you chose
* why you chose them
* what story you might like to tell
* what type of data you have (time-series, geospatial, graph data)?
* how you expect your audience to engage with those data. 

Link to the datasets if they are available online, if not, explain how you intend to get those data over the course of the next few weeks.

Example:

> In the pracice files, there are no stylesheets linked in the `index.html`, whereas in the completed files there are two stylesheets, `styles.css` and `reset.css`. Tell me what the addition of these files does for the resulting website?

List your "3 things" in a gist, as you do each week for your assignments.

Try using [these practice files](http://bl.ocks.org/auremoser/2302e34cf80b55123564f96c351a3146), and modifying them to create your own visualization with [RAW](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/). Attach those files (index.html, and styles, if any) to your gist.

#### STATISTICS AND TIME-SERIES INTERACTIVES

> "In short, we're tasked with transforming data into directives. Good analysis parses numerical outputs into an understanding of the organization. We "humanize" the data by turning raw numbers into a story about our performance." ~ J. Bladt + B. Filbin

This week continues our visualization series, we'll be exploring data sets for time-series interactives and statistical charts/graphs. We'll feature a guest talk from Francis Tseng as well.

#### PRACTICE
[C3.JS](http://c3js.org/) is a reusable chart library based on D3. Take a look at [the code for this Timeseries Chart](http://c3js.org/samples/timeseries.html) and think about how you could modify it to accommodate data of your choice.

Try to do that and integrate your practice into the assignment below (add it to you bl.ocks account if you can!).

Here is [an example using C3.JS for a time-series line chart](http://bl.ocks.org/auremoser/0d84614ac07aaa47e803). If you feel like this is more relevant to your dataset, you can use that template too.

#### ASSIGNMENT
1. Find some time-series or statistical data. 
2. Think about the narrative that you might build around it. 
3. Write a pitch (< 3 ¶s) explaining your story and linking to the data. 
4. Defend your pitch in a few short arguments, describing the format of your data, and what tools/languages you would use to explore and visualize it.
5. Use your practice exercise to defend your pitch with a prototype.

#### COLOR THEORY: ART, DESIGN, + PERCEPTION
>"It’s not uncommon for designers to confuse a beautiful looking product with one that works beautifully. A great technique for creating smarter, better products is to approach them using story-centered design." ~ B. Kowitz

Color and mood are important to visualizations and the general legibility of your narrative. We'll discuss ways to convey or amplify your story with design, and think through some of the aesthetics of your interactives to come.

#### ASSIGNMENT
Make a few sketches of the data visualizations that might suit your project, take a photo of those sketches and create a style guide or swatch board (with color palette, fonts, layout indications) in a gist. These can build on your prototype time-series, mapping, or graph visualizations from previous weeks, but should reflect your "ideal" layout and not be limited to what you were able to accomplish in previous weeks.

It doesn't have to be as detailed as [this one](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/03/12/datavizguide/) but it should have a few main sections:

* Colors (hex values chosen)
* Fonts
* Template (general layout, with sketches-hand sketched and photographed/embedded in a gist or uploaded somewhere.
* Description of the dataset(s)
* Description of the concept and larger narrative - what aspects of your data will this style highlight?

## 11/09/17
#### CHOOSING AN INTERACTIVE

Choosing a way to display your data is a non-trivial operation, and using the past few weeks' study of a few general visualization types, we'll discuss what combination of visual data diagrams best suit the data we've groomed for our final projects. We'll also go over some of the tools for rendering those data as such.

#### ASSIGNMENT - PROPOSAL
Consider the data visualization types in [this catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/), and the [tools listed here](http://selection.datavisualization.ch/). 

Determine which type of visualizations you might make with your data, list them, and then select one to test and pursue. 

Diagram (aka, discuss in one ¶) what type of visualization you choose for your dataset and what tools you will use to achieve this (include the languages they are written in or the languages you might need to code in). 

Keep in mind how this changes or updates your style guide from last week; update that assignment where necessary; and link to the style guide at the end of your proposal.

#### CREATIVE NARRATIVE

>"And I want you to ask yourself when you make things, when you prototype interactions, 'am I thinking about my own clock, or the user’s?' Am I going to help someone make order in his or her life, or am I going to send that person to a commune in Vermont?" ~ P. Ford

This week we'll talk about creative approaches to building narrative and new methods for publishing interactive material. We will likewise learn more about hosting our projects on github or otherwise.

#### PRACTICE
Think about where you would like to publish your project and in what format. Will it be a stand-alone site with some text, a text-dense narrative with embedded graphs, a larger scroll-pages multimedia piece with images and video embeds to compliment? 

#### ASSIGNMENT
Think about the interactives we've seen this semester and plan out your template layout.

Reconsider your data and the pitch exercises from previous weeks, choose the best visualization and pitch for your narrative and pursue pushing that onto the web.

Here are some resources to help you get it on the web.

* [Github pages templates for sites](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Creating project pages on Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/)

Here is [an example of an interactive time series visualization](http://auremoser.github.io/graphitiTime/) of Graffiti cleanup rates (taken from 311 data). Here is [the code and readme](https://github.com/auremoser/graphitiTime/) explaining how this was made. This will be the format of your final projects (unless you choose a more creative way of hosting it). All of your code will be submitted on github with at least a link to the live demo in the `README.md` of your repository.

#### FINAL PROJECTS
**DUE**: 12/14/17 9AM, in my inbox. 

Please send the link to your project repository and any supportive materials to my email <amoser2@sva.edu>.

Final Project Guide: <https://gist.github.com/auremoser/6cdf8d61bb3bcbba7606>

We will spend the first minutes of class going over your project pitches, please send me your current assignment/latest project draft **before** class, and prepare a 3-5 minute presentation of your project, describing why you chose it, what resulted from your efforts and what you would like to do with the project moving forward.

But in general, this project is a big deal! The final project is a substantial portion of your grade, and there will be no late grading because they lock me out of the grading system 7 days after our last class (around the 21st); ie. no late grades accepted.

This will be a follow-up lab to polish your projects and get extra-help. 

There will be no class. Instead, each student will make individual appointments with me to meet over Google Hangouts and discuss his/her project and get help with bugs, issues, or fixing final projects.

An invite will be sent to coordinate this meeting the week prior.

This meeting will go over:

* the status of your project
* any lingering problems to troubleshoot
* how to evaluate and test your projects prior to submission
* how to document your project

# SERVICES + RESOURCES

### CODE (OF CONDUCT)
It's not that hard, code or respect. You will be expected to produce both in this class. 

This code of conduct is a partnership we are building in mutual respect. I take it personally when you miss my classes and my assignments; being ontime is a way to show myself and the other students that you have respect for us. If you fail to do that, you're hindering your own education, but more importantly you're hindering your reputation as a person with integrity. 

Here are a few general things:

* Late assignments will not be accepted 
* Attendance is mandatory barring an emergency which you can work out with the instructor over email. 
* Regardless of circumstances, you're expected to turn in your assignment on the day that it's due, and otherwise keep up with work.
